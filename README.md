# EV Charging Infrastructure & Power Grid Impact Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the integration of **Electric Vehicle (EV)** charging stations into the electrical distribution network. Using **Python** for algorithmic logic and **DIgSILENT PowerFactory** for power system simulation, the tool analyzes how EV load growth affects grid stability.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Load Forecasting**: Calculates power demand from EV charging stations based on vehicle density and charging profiles.
- **Grid Simulation**: Integrates with DIgSILENT to perform Load Flow analysis and identify potential voltage violations or transformer overloads.
- **Optimization**: Suggests optimal charging station placement to minimize power losses and maintain grid reliability.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Programming**: Python (Data processing & Automation)
- **Power System Tool**: DIgSILENT PowerFactory
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib/HTML Maps

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Acquisition**: Extracting network topology and EV charging parameters.
2. **Simulation**: Running steady-state analysis to observe voltage profiles.
3. **Evaluation**: Assessing the impact of "Smart Charging" vs. "Uncoordinated Charging" scenarios.
